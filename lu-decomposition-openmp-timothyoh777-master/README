Contents of this directory

  interactive.sh: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    in the interactive queue on a compute node

    usage:

      source interactive.sh

  reservation.sh: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    in the interactive queue on a compute node using the class
    reservation

    usage:

      source reservation.sh

  display.sh:
    to understand thread affinity, execute the command below to set your 
    environment variables to display information about OpenMP thread bindings.
    when you run programs with these settings, the OpenMP runtime will 
    describe HW thread bindings for OpenMP worker threads.

    usage:

      source display.sh

  /projects/comp422/affinity/affinity
    this program will show how many threads are available and
    what hardware threads each software thread may run on.
    this utility can be used to make sure that your slurm command
    configured the node appropriately for your experiments.

  lu-omp.cpp: template for OpenMP solution

  Makefile:
    a Makefile that includes recipes for building and running your program

    usage:

      make # builds your code
      make runp # runs a parallel version of your code on W workers
      make runs # runs a serial version of your code on one worker
      make check # runs your parallel code with Intel Thread Checker
      make view # inspect the results of make check with Intel's GUI. 
        note: this command will only work on the login node displaying using X11 

  submit.sbatch:
    a script that you can use to launch a batch job that will execute 
    a series of tests on 1..32 threads on a compute node

    usage:
        sbatch submit.sbatch
